# Spam_detector_using_ML
A machine learning-based spam mail detection system using Logistic Regression. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of emails, with feature extraction using TF-IDF to capture word importance. It classifies emails as spam or not based on textual patterns, achieving high accuracy.
This project is a machine learning-based spam mail detector built with Logistic Regression. Designed to classify emails as spam or legitimate, it leverages key NLP techniques for robust performance.

Key Features:

Logistic Regression Model: We use Logistic Regression due to its simplicity, efficiency, and effectiveness in binary classification. The model is trained on a labeled email dataset, with spam and non-spam (ham) categories, achieving high accuracy by learning from the distinguishing patterns in word usage.

Feature Extraction with TF-IDF: To enhance classification, we use Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) for feature extraction. This method quantifies word relevance, highlighting terms that are more frequent in spam emails but less common in regular emails, improving model accuracy.

Data Preprocessing: Includes steps such as text normalization, removing stopwords, and handling punctuation, making the model robust against variations in email content.

Model Evaluation: The project includes evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, offering insights into model performance and fine-tuning opportunities.

Scalable and Extendable: This detector can be extended with other classifiers or combined with ensemble methods to enhance accuracy. The project can also integrate more complex preprocessing techniques or additional datasets for broader application.

This system demonstrates a straightforward, effective approach to spam detection, serving as a foundation for future improvements and integration into real-world applications. Ideal for learning ML with text classification!
